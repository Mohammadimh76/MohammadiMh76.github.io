## Summary
Vision is one of the most critical special senses, not only because it plays an essential role in the external environment. If not treated in time (especially in childhood), many eye diseases cause blindness and cause irreparable problems for sick people. They will have many limitations in the individual and social life of the patients. However, early detection and diagnosis of diseases have always been critical, and one of the purposes of this invention is to identify heterochromia in infants. The preventive policy of this idea is essential to predict and identify diseases and underlying factors. The mechanism of this disease takes steps.<br>
In this idea, there is a new method for presenting, examining, and diagnosing color changes in the irises of the eye and the degree of conformity, uniformity, and uniformity of color in all parts of the iris, and more specialized for measuring and diagnosing ocular heterochromia in infancy and Early to prevent the progression and inhibition of the activity and progression of underlying and related diseases. Its main principles are based on the processing of images and videos taken from the eye, and according to the output of artificial intelligence algorithms, the percentage of similarity of the irises of the eye in terms of all colorimetric parameters in terms of color type, becoming, matching, uniformity and ... In other words, this device is designed to predict or diagnose heterochromia and its related diseases in infants.<br>

## Explain at least one practical method for applying the invention
This system is used to measure the density and uniformity of iris color and its accessories in order to examine the eye to diagnose heterochromia in infants. Its main principles are based on the processing of images and videos taken from the eye, and according to the output of artificial intelligence algorithms, the percentage of similarity of the irises of the eye in terms of all colorimetric parameters in terms of color type, becoming, matching, uniformity and ... In other words, this device is designed to predict or diagnose heterochromia and its related diseases in infants.<br>
This system is a set of interconnected electronic, mechanical and physical factors that are designed to predict or diagnose heterochromia and its related diseases in infants.
This system is used in medical, diagnostic, laboratory, and home centers to check the degree and percentage of iris color matching, in other words, to check whether or not there is heterochromia.
