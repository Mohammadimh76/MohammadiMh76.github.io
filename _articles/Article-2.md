## Abstract

Telemedicine uses information technology such as computers and telecommunications systems to provide telemedicine and health care. These technical issues can be divided into telecommunications with wireless video and audio technology and networking; Telemedicine is used to improve the quality of treatment, improve communication between medical centers, optimize access to specialists, reduce the need for patient transportation, and reduce treatment costs.<br>

Communication technology makes it possible to provide medical services to centers that are geographically separate from the provider. Telemedicine communication is usually provided through ordinary telephone lines to transmit digital signals to a computer. Advanced communication facilities such as fiber optics, satellite lines, and the like provide a wide range of information transfer facilities. In this research, the types, basics, and principles of telemedicine systems have been discussed, and their types and the basic design level of each department have been introduced separately.<br>
