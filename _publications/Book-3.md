## 〽️Introduction:
Today, compression methods have found many applications in various aspects of computers and communications. The purpose of image compression is to reduce the redundancy of image contents. In other words, image compression means storing it as a set of transformations.<br>
Compression is a type of coding operation in which input data is encoded in a way that takes up less space and can be retrieved at any time and return the original data to us. The primary purpose of data compression is to reduce the volume of data. Today's information systems directly or indirectly benefit from the benefits of compression methods. The dissertation in front of you attempts to introduce image compression methods and implement some of these algorithms on standard images.<br>

## Chapter (1) - General
The purpose of image compression is to reduce the redundancy of image contents. In other words, image compression means storing it as a set of conversions. The reduction is a type of coding operation in which the input data is encoded in a way that takes up less space and can be retrieved at any time and return the original data to us.<br>
The primary purpose of compression is to reduce the size of the data. Perhaps many years ago, when it came to reduction, this goal was huge. Why were data storage resources so limited and so expensive? Now it seems that time is over, and today the need for compression has not diminished but is also increasing. And there is a difference in how compression methods are applied.<br>

## Chapter (2) - Basics of medical imaging
Medical imaging is the technique and process used to make images of the human body (or parts and functions) for clinical purposes (medical procedures that seek to identify, treat, and evaluate diseases) or medical sciences (including anatomical and physiological studies). Medical imaging is an interplay of several disciplines such as medical physics, medical engineering, biology, and optics.<br>
Although there is no written history of medical imaging, physicists, and engineers' role in the historical context can be glimpsed.<br>
The first modern imaging technique and modality date back to 1895 with the discovery of X-rays by Mr. William Roentgen. Most physical efforts to advance radiographic and X-ray imaging systems, such as intensifiers, cross-sections, rotation of anodic ducts, etc., occurred 10 to 20 years later.<br>
But the exciting thing about this was that the dramatic changes and improvements in the internal imaging of diseases came more from laboratory people's creativity than from physicists and engineers. A variety of methods were developed for imaging obscure selected areas. These include catheters, pigments of oral and intravenous actuators. Thus, when radiologists faced the limitations of operating devices, they devised various methods, sometimes aggressive, to facilitate imaging of missing organs.<br>
From the early 1950s to the 1970s, there was a revolution in diagnostic imaging systems. New systems were developed for non-invasive anatomical and functional imaging (disease process). Physicists and engineers played a dominant role in this. The revolution began with nuclear and ultrasound imaging, which imaged the disease process despite severe imaging limitations, which was impossible before and without these methods. Computer chronography was another area of medical imagery that emerged in the early 1970s. This technique produced excellent cross-sectional images, which corresponded to the information obtained from exploratory surgeries. Devices developed rapidly, and standard procedures for various methods were introduced.<br>
Revolutions and developments in imaging techniques continued. These developments led to profound improvements to existing systems and necessary studies for the formation of new imaging modalities. These new methods included the use of microwaves and the phenomenon of nuclear magnetic resonance.<br>
Many attribute the birth of diagnostic radiology to 1896. That year, The Lancet reported on a surgery that used X-rays for the first time to find an iron piece inside a sailor's lumbar spine. The sailor was paralyzed when a piece of iron was removed from his body. This method (using X-rays to see inside the body) quickly spread to Europe and the United States.<br>

## Chapter (3) - Aerial imagery
Today, drones are widely used and considered one of the most essential and efficient types of military and defense equipment. These deep-impact drones can gain valuable information and help commanders advance their goals. In addition to the limitations that a reconnaissance aircraft may have in carrying out its mission, these birds play an excellent role.<br>
The term "drone" stands for "remote-controlled aircraft," which is defined for drones and is made up of the words' initials. Today, drones have become a hot topic in technology, and various companies are using this technology tool. Some companies are working on controlling and improving the navigation system of these useful tools, and others are coming up with new ideas for more applications.<br>

## Chapter (4) - Basics of compression
The purpose of image compression is to reduce the redundancy of the contents of the image. In other words, image compression means storing it as a set of transformations. The reduction of a file capacity depends on several factors such as file type, file size, method, and algorithm used by the compression program. Photo compression can be done without loss and high loss (loss, loss, games, waste).<br>

## Chapter (5) - Check how the program works
In this chapter, we will review and analyze how the designed program works.

## Chapter (6) - Conclusion
In this research, an algorithm based on wavelet functions was performed to compress and encode images and decode and reconstruct the image. Finally, easy-to-use software was designed in a MATLAB environment. The results showed that this algorithm could compress and encode images at the desired level. However, by improving the functions used, the execution speed of the algorithm can be increased. In this algorithm, an attempt has been made to do more image processing to increase the algorithm's usability at the destination. As a result, fewer electronic components can be used for processing at the transmitter, and the central processor can be used at the destination where more equipment can be used.<br>
