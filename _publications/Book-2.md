## „ÄΩÔ∏èIntroduction:
As the world of technology evolves, new areas are emerging, culminating in the digital age. The Internet of Things is emerging as one of the main trends shaping the development of technology in the field of information and communication technology, and the change in the use of the Internet to communicate between end-users to the Internet used to communicate between physical objects to a particular service Requires a rethinking of some traditional approaches to network management, computing, and service delivery.<br>
The book Basics of IoT, written by Seyed Yahya Moradi and Mohammad Hossein Mohammadi, intends to provide a comprehensive introduction to all aspects of IoT technology to guide readers to continue their education and work path.<br>
This book consists of six chapters in which an attempt has been made to explain all the topics of this technology comprehensively and fluently for those who are interested, students and university professors.<br>

## Chapter (1) - IoT (Internet of Things) Tutorial
IoT stands for Internet of Things, which means accessing and controlling equipment and devices that can be used on a daily basis using the Internet.<br>
This book covers all IoT topics including introductions, features, advantages and disadvantages, ecosystems, decision frameworks, architecture and domains, biometrics, security cameras and door unlock systems, devices, and more.

## Chapter (2) - Architecture & Domains
This chapter discusses the IoT architecture in particular.

## Chapter (3) - IoT Devices
What are smart objects in the IoT?
The IoT concept is used for active physical, digital, network objects that can be somewhat automated, reset, and control local resources locally. Smart objects need energy, data storage, and more.<br>
A smart body is an object that enhances interaction with other smart objects as well as with people. The IoT world is a network of heterogeneous interconnected objects (such as smart devices, smart smart objects, sensors, actuators, RFID, embedded computers, etc.) uniquely addressable and based on protocols. Standard communication.<br>
In everyday life, people have a lot of object objects with the Internet or wireless or wired connection. like the:

- Smart phones
- Tablet
- Computer TV

These objects can be interconnected and facilitate our daily lives (smart home, smart cities) regardless of location, location, access to a sensor, size, scenario or hazard.<br>
Smart objects are widely used to transform the physical environment around us into the digital world using IoT technology.<br>
A smart object carries blocks of application logic that make sense for their local location and interact with human users. An intelligent smart object senses, records, interprets, communicates with each other, and exchanges information with people.<br>
The work of the smart object is focused on technical aspects (such as software infrastructure, hardware operating systems, etc.) and application scenarios. Application areas range from supply chain management and organizational programs (home and hospital) to healthcare and industrial workplace support. As for the human interface aspects of object-smart technologies, the environment has just received attention.<br>

## Chapter (4) - IoT Platforms
Like the IoT, all IoT devices are connected to other IoT devices and applications connected to transmit and receive information using protocols. There is a gap between the IoT device and the IoT application. The IoT Platform fills the gap between devices (sensors) and applications (networks). Therefore, it can be said that an IoT platform is an integrated service that bridges the gap between the device and the IoT application and allows you to perform the physical object online.<br>

## Chapter (5) - Communication
IoT Data Link Communication Protocol<br>
The IoT Data Link communication protocol provides service to the Network Layer. There are various protocols and standard technologies specified by the different organization for data link protocols.<br>

## Chapter (6) - IoT + Arduino
Examples of IoT projects
