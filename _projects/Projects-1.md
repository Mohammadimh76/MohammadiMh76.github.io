## Viola–Jones object detection framework

The Viola–Jones object detection framework is an object detection framework which was proposed in 2001 by Paul Viola and Michael Jones. Although it can be trained to detect a variety of object classes, it was motivated primarily by the problem of face detection.(wikipedia)<br>
In this project, first, a graphical environment has been designed using MATLAB programming language to communicate better with the user.<br>
